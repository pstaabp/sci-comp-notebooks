    "* _Flush_: All cards have the same suit. We will exclude straight flushes.\n",
    "* _Straight_: The ranks of the 5 cards are sequential and ace can be high or low. Again, we will exclude straight flushes.\n",
    "* _Four of a kind_: four of the cards have the same rank\n",
    "* _Full House_: two cards have the same rank, the other three cards have the same rank. The suit doesn’t matter.\n",
    "* _Three of a kind_: three of the cards have the same rank. The other two cards do not have the same rank. The suit of the cards doesn’t matter and also, make sure that the other two cards are not a pair or that would be a full house.\n",
    "* _Two pairs_: Two cards have the same rank. Two of the remaining cards have the same rank, but different than the first two pair. The 5th card does not make it a full house.\n",
    "* One pair: two cards have the same rank. The remaining cards do not make it a different type of hand (full house, three of a kind, etc.)\n",
    "* _No pair_ or _nothing_: the cards don’t form any other hand. This is also called _High Card_, in that if comparing hands, the highest card in the hand is important."
