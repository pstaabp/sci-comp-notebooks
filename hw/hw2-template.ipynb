    "(see the pdf on blackboard) and continues for all $x$. Write a julia function that calculates this function and show some code that you tested it. That is, you should write a function that take in any real number and returns the height of the curve. For example $f(−0.5) = 0.5, f(1.25) = 0.75$, and $f(−3) = 1$. Hint: the modulo function `mod` can be quite helpful. For example, `5.5 % 2.0` returns `1.5`, so the height at `5.5` is the same as the height at `1.5`.\n",
